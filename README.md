# Broken React TO DO application based on context api

This project was created for the article ["React coding interview task"](https://medium.com/@andrey.igorevich.borisov/react-coding-interview-task-c9f21fb872e2)

This application was intentionally broken, there are six critical issues that a candidate has to fix:

1. Fix an ability to display all tasks.
2. Fix a layout, checkboxes should be listed in a column.
3. Fix an ability to add a new task.
4. Fix an ability to toggle a task.
5. Fix an ability to delete a task.
6. Fix an ability to count completed tasks.

The working example can be found at https://github.com/andrewborisov/react-todo-application-context-api
